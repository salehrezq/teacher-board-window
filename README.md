## Students instances monitor

The teacher can monitor his/her students connected instances of [student-board-window](https://github.com/salehrezq/student-board-window).

For brevity I will refer to "student-board-window" as SBW. The student himself can control the SBW instance running in his/her machine. The teacher has a monitor window through which he can get instant feedback regarding which status each SBW window is at.

- Active: green color means that the SBW instance is the active window, if not it becomes red.
- Upfornt: green color means that the SBW instance is upfront, red color means it is minimized to the taskbar.
- Fullscreen: green color means that the SBW instance is maximized (it is not literally a fullscreen), red color means the window is resized.
